# Web Projects using Vanilla JS
This is the main repository containing the different folders for my mini web projects. This list will continually get updated as more projects are added.

### 1) Custom Video player
Easy ways to get video players, using HTML5, and various libraries. But it is definitely nice making one from scratch.

### 3) Form Validator
Build your own custom validator. Like the video player, there are easy ways including libraries to get this done. But it's nice to practice your JS skills with a custom build.
